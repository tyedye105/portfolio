      <h2>Once upon a time...</h2>
        <p class="content"> I was an aspiring musician, hoping to one day become the next great videogame composer. As a lowly saxophonist I began my journey at the University of Oregon.  During my journey I would ultimately fail.  After a first two terms in the second year composition, fighting the burnout the best I could, I finally succumbed to it. I moved on to my fall back, Japanese a language I had studied since highschool and continued to do so when I could take the clasess.
        Finally almost 8 years floundering in the high education system, I achieved a degree in Japanese, however with my confidence at an all time low in the lanagauge, I set out to get a mundane job.
      </p>
      <h2>Upwards and onwards!</h2>
        <p class="content">
          With almost two years lost to the mundane job, I sought out to enroll in Epicodus to go down a path I previously toyed with the idea. Coding.  Videogames and computers have always been apart of my life, so has creating, so why not jump into the abyss of 1's and 0's head first. Through learning to code, I hope not to just open up new job oppurtunities, but new mediums for me to create in!
