        <h2>Once upon a time...</h2>
          <p class="content"> I was an aspiring musician, hoping to one day become the next great videogame composer. As a lowly saxophonist I began my long journey at the University of Oregon.  However, after a first two terms in second year composition I found myself burnt out. After much internal and exteranl debate I moved to my fall back. Japanese a language I had studied since highschool and continued to do so when I could take the clasess.
          Finally, almost 8 years of floundering in the higher education system, I achieved a degree in Japanese, however with my confidence at an all time low in the lanagauge, I set out to get a <span class="req">mundane job.</span>
          </p>
        <h2>Upwards and onwards!</h2>
          <p class="content">
            With almost two years lost to the <span class="req">mundane job.</span>, I sought out to enroll in Epicodus to go down a path that I have thought about going down. Coding.  Videogames and computers have always been apart of my life, so has creating, so why not jump into the abyss of 1's and 0's head first. Through learning to code, I hope not to just open up new job oppurtunities, but new mediums for me to create in!
